Delay rates also seem to differ by carrier, by time of day, as well as by origin and destination airports. For weather, we see a strong distinction between delays when Weather = 1 (in that case there is always a delay) and Weather =0. The heatmap in Figure 10.5 reveals some specific combinations with high rates of delays, such as Sunday flights by carrier RU, departing from BWI, or Sunday flights by MQ departing from DCA. We can also see combinations with very low delay rates."
