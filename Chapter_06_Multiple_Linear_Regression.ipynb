Tells if the model is over-forecasting or under-forecasting.<br>• **Interpretation:**<br>  - $ME > 0$: Under-forecast (Actual > Predicted).<br>  - $ME < 0$: Over-forecast (Actual < Predicted).<br>• **Note:** $ME \\approx 0$ does not mean the model is good (positive and negative errors cancel out). |\n",

Use when the cost of error increases **linearly**.<br>• **Pros/Cons:** Robust to outliers (does not penalize large errors heavily). |\n",
        "| **RMSE** | **Root Mean Squared Error** | $$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}$$ | • **Meaning:** Standard deviation of the prediction errors.<br>• **Usage:** Use when you want to heavily penalize **large errors** (outliers).<br>• **Pros/Cons:** Very sensitive to outliers. A few bad predictions can inflate RMSE significantly. |\n",

Can \"explode\" if values are very small. |\n",
