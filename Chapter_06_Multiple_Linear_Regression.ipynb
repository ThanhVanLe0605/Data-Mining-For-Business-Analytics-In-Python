        "A frequent problem in data mining is using a regression equation to predict the value of a dependent variable when there are too many variables available to choose as predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the high processing speeds of modern algorithms for multiple regression calculations, analysts are often tempted by the **\"kitchen-sink approach\"**: Why bother selecting a subset? Just throw all variables into the model. However, there are several reasons to exercise caution before including every possible variable in a model:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Cost and Feasibility:** It might be expensive or unfeasible to collect the full set of predictors for future predictions.\n",
        "2.  **Accuracy:** We might be able to measure fewer predictors more accurately (e.g., in surveys).\n",
        "3.  **Missing Values:** The more predictors used, the higher the chance of missing data. If we delete or impute missing records, having many predictors leads to a higher rate of record deletion/imputation.\n",
        "4.  **Parsimony:** This is a crucial property of good models. We gain more insight into the influence of predictors in models with fewer parameters.\n",
        "5.  **Multicollinearity:** Regression coefficient estimates are likely to be unstable due to multicollinearity (the presence of two or more predictors sharing the same linear relationship). A rough rule of thumb is that the number of records $n$ should be greater than $5(p + 2)$, where $p$ is the number of predictors.\n",
        "6.  **Bias-Variance Trade-off:**\n",
        "    * Using predictors that are uncorrelated with the outcome variable will **increase the variance** of predictions.\n",
        "    * Dropping predictors that are actually correlated with the outcome variable can **increase the average error (bias)** of predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This trade-off is particularly important when dealing with a large number of predictors. Removing \"noise\" variables (those with small coefficients relative to standard deviation and correlated with others) improves prediction because it reduces prediction variance. Therefore, methods to reduce the number of predictors $p$ to a smaller subset are frequently used.\n",

Useful tools include frequency tables, correlation matrices, and summary plots.\n",

They exhibit high **standard errors** (high variance), meaning small changes in training data can lead to drastically different models.\n",

        "*Process goes from Simple to Complex.*\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Process:**\n",
        "    * **Initialization:** Start with a **Null Model** (intercept only, no variables).\n",
        "    * **Loop:**\n",
        "        * Examine candidate variables one by one.\n",
        "        * In the first step, select the variable with the highest correlation ($r$) with $Y$.\n",
        "        * In subsequent steps, select the variable with the highest **Squared Semi-partial Correlation ($sr^2$)**. This is the variable that reduces SSE the most on the residuals left unexplained by previous variables.\n",
        "    * **Stopping Rule:** The selected variable must pass a \"hurdle\" (typically **p-value < 0.05**). If the reduction in SSE is not statistically significant, the process stops.\n",
        "2.  **Core Characteristic:** \"Once in, never out.\" Once a variable enters the model, it stays forever.\n",
        "3.  **Flaws:**\n",
        "    * **Redundancy:** A variable entered early may become insignificant when stronger variables enter later (due to multicollinearity or overlap), but Forward Selection has no mechanism to remove it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### II. Backward Elimination (Iterative)\n",
        "*Process goes from Complex to Simple.*\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Process:**\n",
        "    * **Initialization:** Start with a **Full Model** (containing all variables).\n",
        "    * **Loop:**\n",
        "        * Test the significance of all current variables.\n",
        "        * Identify the variable contributing the least to error reduction (highest p-value).\n",
        "        * If this variable's p-value violates the stopping rule (e.g., > 0.05), it is removed.\n",
        "    * **Conclusion:** Repeat until all remaining variables are statistically significant.\n",
        "2.  **Core Characteristic:** \"Once out, never back.\" Once a variable is removed, it is gone forever.\n",
        "3.  **Flaws:**\n",
        "    * **Lost Potential:** A variable removed early might have been important if paired with other variables later (interaction effects), but it loses the chance to return.\n",
        "    * **Temptation Factor:** Analysts may be tempted to keep too many variables if the stopping rule is not strictly defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "### III. Stepwise Regression (Iterative)\n",
        "*A smart hybrid technique overcoming the flaws of the previous two.*\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Process:**\n",
        "    * **Add Step (Forward):** Start like Forward Selection, adding the variable with the highest $sr^2$.\n",
        "    * **Check Step (Backward):** Immediately after adding a new variable, the algorithm performs a \"backward look.\" It re-evaluates all old variables in the model.\n",
        "    * **Removal:** If the arrival of the new variable makes an old variable redundant (its p-value increases and loses significance), the old variable is removed.\n",
        "2.  **Pros:**\n",
        "    * **Flexible:** Variables can enter and leave the model.\n",
        "    * **Handles Multicollinearity:** Effectively manages overlapping information between variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "### IV. Best Subsets Regression (Non-iterative)\n",
        "*The \"Brute-force\" technique.*\n",

        "    * **Pro:** Guarantees finding the mathematically optimal model.\n",
        "    * **Con:** **Computationally expensive**. The number of models to run is $2^k$, which increases exponentially with the number of variables.\n",

        "    * On the same dataset, the 4 methods (Forward, Backward, Stepwise, Best Subsets) may propose **4 different \"best\" models**. None are absolutely wrong; they simply optimize via different mathematical paths.\n",

        "    * Computers only run algorithms. Humans decide the outcome:\n",
        "        * **Stopping Rule:** Do you choose a strict p-value (0.01) or a loose one (0.10)?\n",
        "        * **Strategy:** Do you choose Best Subsets (for small data) or Stepwise (for big data)?\n",
        "        * **Business Sense:** A variable might be statistically significant (good p-value) but nonsensical in business terms (e.g., house price increases as size decreases). In such cases, the Data Scientist must remove it regardless of the algorithm."

        "\n",
        "### 1. Design Philosophy & Scikit-learn Pipeline\n",
        "The deprecation of the `normalize=True` parameter in Scikit-learn estimators (since v1.2) reflects three core principles of modern Machine Learning design:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Separation of Concerns:**\n",
        "    * **Concept:** An **Estimator** (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) should focus solely on learning model parameters. Data transformation is the responsibility of dedicated **Transformers** (e.g., `StandardScaler`).\n",
        "    * **Benefit:** Keeps the codebase modular, clear, and maintainable.\n",
        "* **Preventing Data Leakage:**\n",
        "    * **Mandatory Pipelines:** Embedding normalization inside the model often leads to calculating statistics (mean, std) on the entire dataset before splitting.\n",
        "    * **Best Practice:** Using a **Pipeline** ensures that scaling statistics are **fit** only on the **Train set** and **applied** to the **Test/Validation set**, preserving the objectivity of the evaluation.\n",
        "* **Removing Ambiguity:**\n",
        "    * **Issue:** The old parameter caused confusion with `preprocessing.Normalizer` and behaved inconsistently when `fit_intercept=False`.\n",
        "    * **Philosophy:** \"Explicit is better than implicit.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Feature Scaling Techniques\n",
        "* **Parametric Approach:**\n",
        "    * **Assumption:** Relies on the Gaussian distribution assumption.\n",
        "    * **Method:** `StandardScaler` (uses Mean and Variance).\n",
        "    * **Drawback:** Highly sensitive to **outliers**.\n",
        "* **Non-parametric Approach:**\n",
        "    * **Assumption:** Based on **Order Statistics** (Quantiles/Median).\n",
        "    * **Method:** `RobustScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`.\n",
        "    * **Advantage:** More **robust** to outliers and non-Gaussian data.\n",
        "* **Handling Complex Distributions:**\n",
        "    * **Scenario:** Multimodal or heavy-tailed distributions.\n",
        "    * **Solution:** `QuantileTransformer`. It uses the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) to perform a non-linear mapping, transforming data to a uniform or normal distribution while preserving rank order.\n",

        "### 3. Invariance and The Necessity of Scaling\n",
        "Understanding **Affine Invariance** is key to determining when scaling is mandatory.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):**\n",
        "    * **Property:** Possesses **Affine Invariance**.\n",
        "    * **Mechanism:** If input variables are rescaled (e.g., meters $\\to$ millimeters), the coefficients ($w$) automatically adjust inversely ($w \\to w/1000$). The prediction $\\hat{y}$ remains unchanged.\n",
        "    * **Conclusion:** Scaling is **not strictly required** (except for numerical stability).\n",
        "* **Regularized Models (Lasso, Ridge, Bayesian):**\n",
        "    * **Property:** **NOT** Affine Invariant.\n",
        "    * **Mechanism:** The objective function includes a penalty term (e.g., $\\lambda ||w||^2$) that depends directly on the magnitude of the coefficients.\n",
        "    * **Risk:** Without scaling, variables with large units (and thus small coefficients) are penalized less than variables with small units.\n",
        "    * **Conclusion:** Scaling is **MANDATORY** to ensure the penalty is applied fairly across all features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Impact on Regularization & Bayesian Priors\n",
        "* **Regularization Fairness:**\n",
        "    * Scaling brings all features to a common scale (e.g., mean=0, std=1). This ensures that the regularization strength ($\\lambda$) controls model complexity based on the feature's actual information, rather than being biased by the arbitrary choice of measurement units.\n",
        "* **Bayesian Regression:**\n",
        "    * **Hierarchical Priors:** When applying priors on scaled data, hyperparameters must be **recalibrated**.\n",
        "    * **Goal:** To ensure priors remain \"weakly informative\" and avoid **double-penalization** or excessive shrinkage of the posterior estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Strategies for Small Samples & Evaluation\n",
        "* **Small-Sample Regimes ($n < 30$):**\n",
        "    * **Strategy:** Prefer **Regularized Estimators** (Ridge/Lasso/Bayesian) over OLS/MLE.\n",
        "    * **Bias-Variance Trade-off:** We accept a small amount of **Bias** to achieve a significant reduction in **Variance**, preventing Overfitting and improving generalization.\n",
        "* **Model Evaluation:**\n",
        "    * **Nested Cross-Validation:** Essential for simultaneous hyperparameter tuning and model selection.\n",
        "        * *Inner Loop:* Selects optimal hyperparameters.\n",
        "        * *Outer Loop:* Estimates the true generalization error.\n",
        "* **Sensitivity Analysis:**\n",
        "    * **Bootstrap Method:** Recommended for assessing **Coefficient Stability** across different scaling techniques. It provides a more comprehensive view of model reliability than standard p-values."
